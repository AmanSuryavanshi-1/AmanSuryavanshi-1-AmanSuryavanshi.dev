            Hi, I&apos;m a <span itemProp="jobTitle">web developer and UI/UX designer</span> dedicated to creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital experiences. With a keen eye for design and a strong technical foundation, I bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality.
          </p>
          <p className="text-forest-700 leading-relaxed">
            I believe that design is about more than just making things look pretty - it&apos;s about solving problems and creating intuitive, enjoyable experiences for users. Whether I&apos;m working on a website or a mobile app, I bring my commitment to design excellence and user-centered thinking to every project I work on.
